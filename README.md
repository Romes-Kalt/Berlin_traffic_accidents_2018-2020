# Berlin Traffic Accidents 2018-2020
### Final Project @ IronHack (Data Analytics Bootcamp, Jan-Mar 2022)
### by Selena Eberwein & Roman Kaltschew

Using the datasets provided by [BerlinOpenData](https://daten.berlin.de/kategorie/verkehr) we take a look at the accidents involving physical injuries (type of accident, kind of injury, road/lighting condition), build different models to show the main factors for them and use the geographical data provided to highlight areas with a high number of accidents.<br>
We also include the accident statitistics provided by [Polizei Berlin](https://www.berlin.de/polizei/aufgaben/verkehrssicherheit/verkehrsunfallstatistik/) to get a general overview on all accidents (including only damage to property).

#### STEPS (timeframe)
+ Data collection, cleaning and combination (up to 3th of March)
+ Basic EDA to gain the first insights (up to the 4th of March)
+ Building different models and choosing the appropriate one(s) (up to the 7th of March)
+ Visualizing our findings and create a narrative (up to the 9th of March)
+ Creating the presentation (up to the 11th of March)
